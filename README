ImHo (short for Image Hosting) is rich internet application, which provides image hosting with opportunity of editing, collecting to albums, estimating, commenting etc.
ImHo is final project of SoftServe IT Academy's Web UI course. We hope this helps us to get the job in SoftServe Company. Thanks our teachers Dmitry Ovcharenko and Pavel Ratushniy for good lessons.
